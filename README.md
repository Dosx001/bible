1. Having a working project is more important than your bullshit ideology

- Unit tests are amazing when refactoring code
- Unit tests are fucking garbage when writing code
- Good test > no test > bad test
- Dry and wet, I rather see patterns than make patterns
- Every decision you make will become a mistake in the future
  - So, a little less planning and a little more doing
- Don't make your job your main source of happiness
  - Only care about the project as much as everyone
- As a project lead create an environment to make everyone care about the project
- Do not dismiss stupid opinions, now you know who to ignore
  - Makes following conversations much easier
- A passionate programmer will overperform in an experiment and playful environment
- A passionate programmer will underperform in an "old" and "boring" environment
- A 9 to 5 programmer will have a constant performance, use your team wisely
- Do not build individuals, help them grow
- Programming at home is a Software Engineering problem, programming at work is a Social Engineering problem
